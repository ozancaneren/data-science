# Heart Disease Prediction

In this repository,  I work on a binary classification problem in which we need to predict a value of the variable “TenYearCHD” (zero or one) that shows whether a patient will develop a heart disease.  The performance criteria I use is the ROC AUC Score.
The methods I use are:
- Simple Decision Tree Classifier
- Bagged Decision Trees Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Adaptive Boosting Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier

I also come up with my own ensemble method which beats all of the above described methods (provides a higher ROC AUC Score).
